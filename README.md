# Before Running the project
Navigate to the root folder of the project and run
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Then set your `PYTHONPATH` variable as follows. Go to the project root
from your terminal and run the following command.
>export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`

You should be able to run any file now using the command
>python3 src/<filename>.py

Please ask me in case you encounter any issues with running the scripts.
